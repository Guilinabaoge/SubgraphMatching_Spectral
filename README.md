> This project is built on top of the paper "In-Memory Subgraph Matching: an In-depth Study" by Dr. Shixuan Sun and Prof. Qiong Luo. https://github.com/RapidsAtHKUST/SubgraphMatching.
> We have improved the pruning power of the local filters by an additional spectral filter utilizing structure information of vertices. 
> The result shows the spectral filter can reduce the query evaluation time in the scenario where the label information of the dataset is limited. 
> For more detail please read my master's thesis [here](https://github.com/Guilinabaoge/SubgraphMatching_Spectral/blob/main/Zhiwei_Spectral_Filter.pdf).
